IR2Vec is a LLVM IR based framework to generate distributed representations for the source code in an unsupervised manner, which can be used to represent programs as input to solve machine learning tasks that take programs as inputs.
It can capture intrinsic characteristics of the program. This is achieved by using the flow analyses information like *Use-Def*, *Reaching Definitions* and *Live Variable information* of the program.

The entities of the IR are modeled as relationships, and their
representations are learned to form a seed embedding vocabulary.For this we create a Knowledge Graph by modelling LLVM IR of the program as entities and relations. Then a representation learning algorithm is used to learn the embeddings of these entities. Such embeddings exhibit semantic relationships and form clusters demonstrating them.

Such seed embeddings are annotated with the flow information to capture semantics of the program and propagated. The vectors to represent programs at various levels (instruction, function, module) can be formed based on the application.

### Performance
We demonstrate the effectiveness of the embeddings on two different tasks 
* Heterogeneous Device Mapping
* Prediction of Thread Coarsening factor
On both of these tasks we achieve better accuracies and speed-ups with very few cases of slow-downs than the state-of-the-art methods.

#### Other Salient Features
* Compatibility with non-sequential models
    * Orders of magnitude of faster training time (Upto 8000x reduction)
    * Non data hungry models
* No Out of Vocabulary issues
    * Sufficient to expose a training space of O(\|opcodes\| + \|types\| + \|arguments\|) 
        * when compared to a training space of O(\|opcodes\| x \|types\| x \|arguments\|) 
    * Maintains very small vocabulary with the embeddings of following entities
