<p> In this paper, we discuss techniques to transform
sequential programs to texture/surface memory optimized CUDA
programs. We achieve this by using PPCG, an automatic parallelizing compiler based on the Polyhedral model. We implemented
a static analysis in PPCG which validates the semantics of the
texturized transformed program. Depending on the results of
the analysis, our algorithm chooses to use texture and/or surface
memory, and alters the Abstract Syntax Tree accordingly. We
also modified the code-generation phase of PPCG to take care
of various subtleties. We evaluated the texturization algorithm
on the PolyBench (4.2.1 beta) benchmark and observed up to
1.6x speedup with a geometric mean of 1.103X. The title and
at many places, the paper uses term Texture memory. But, the
optimizations are for Texture and Surface memory.</p>
