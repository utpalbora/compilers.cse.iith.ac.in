  abstract = {For Affine Control Programs or Static Control Programs (SCoP), symbolic counting of reuse distances could induce polynomials for each reuse pair. These polynomials along with cache capacity constraints lead to non-affine (semi-algebraic) sets; and counting these sets is considered to be a hard problem. The state-of-the-art methods use various exact enumeration techniques relying on existing cardinality algorithms that can efficiently count affine sets.We propose BullsEye , a novel, scalable, accurate, and problem-size independent approximation framework. It is an analytical cache model for fully associative caches with LRU replacement policy focusing on sampling and linearization of non-affine stack distance polynomials. First, we propose a simple domain sampling method that can improve the scalability of exact enumeration. Second, we propose linearization techniques relying on Handelman’s theorem and Bernstein’s representation. To improve the scalability of the Handelman’s theorem linearization technique, we propose template (Interval or Octagon) sub-polyhedral approximations.Our methods obtain significant compile-time improvements with high-accuracy when compared to HayStack on important polyhedral compilation kernels such as nussinov, cholesky, and adi from PolyBench, and harris, gaussianblur from LLVM-TestSuite. Overall, on PolyBench kernels, our methods show up to 3.31\texttimes{} (geomean) speedup with errors below ≈ 0.08% (geomean) for the octagon sub-polyhedral approximation.},

  abstract = {Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have revolutionized many aspects of our lives. The use of DNNs is becoming ubiquitous, including in software for image recognition, speech recognition, speech synthesis, language translation, to name a few. The training of DNN architectures, however, is computationally expensive. Once the model is created, its use in the intended application—the inference task, is computationally heavy too and the inference needs to be fast for real time use. For obtaining high performance today, the code of Deep Learning (DL) primitives optimized for specific architectures by expert programmers exposed via libraries is the norm. However, given the constant emergence of new DNN architectures, creating hand optimized code is expensive, slow and is not scalable.To address this performance-productivity challenge, in this article we present compiler algorithms to automatically generate high-performance implementations of DL primitives that closely match the performance of hand optimized libraries. We develop novel data reuse analysis algorithms using the polyhedral model to derive efficient execution schedules automatically. In addition, because most DL primitives use some variant of matrix multiplication at their core, we develop a flexible framework where it is possible to plug in library implementations of the same in lieu of a subset of the loops. We show that such a hybrid compiler plus a minimal library-use approach results in state-of-the-art performance. We develop compiler algorithms to also perform operator fusions that reduce data movement through the memory hierarchy of the computer system. Using Convolution Neural Network (CNN) models and matrix multiplication operations, we demonstrate that our approach automatically creates high performing DNN building blocks whose performance matches the performance of hand-crafted kernels of Intel’s oneDNN library on high end CPUs. At the same time, our techniques take only a fraction of time (1/20 or less) compared to AutoTVM, a deep learning auto-tuner to create optimized implementations.},

  abstract = {We propose IR2VEC, a Concise and Scalable encoding infrastructure to represent programs as a distributed embedding in continuous space. This distributed embedding is obtained by combining representation learning methods with flow information to capture the syntax as well as the semantics of the input programs. As our infrastructure is based on the Intermediate Representation (IR) of the source code, obtained embeddings are both language and machine independent. The entities of the IR are modeled as relationships, and their representations are learned to form a seed embedding vocabulary. Using this infrastructure, we propose two incremental encodings: Symbolic and Flow-Aware. Symbolic encodings are obtained from the seed embedding vocabulary, and Flow-Aware encodings are obtained by augmenting the Symbolic encodings with the flow information.We show the effectiveness of our methodology on two optimization tasks (Heterogeneous device mapping and Thread coarsening). Our way of representing the programs enables us to use non-sequential models resulting in orders of magnitude of faster training time. Both the encodings generated by IR2VEC outperform the existing methods in both the tasks, even while using simple machine learning models. In particular, our results improve or match the state-of-the-art speedup in 11/14 benchmark-suites in the device mapping task across two platforms and 53/68 benchmarks in the thread coarsening task across four different platforms. When compared to the other methods, our embeddings are more scalable, is non-data-hungry, and has better Out-Of-Vocabulary (OOV) characteristics.},

Specifying parallelism with frameworks such as OpenMP is relatively easy, but data races in these programs are an important source of bugs. In this article, we propose LLOV, a fast, lightweight, language agnostic, and static data race checker for OpenMP programs based on the LLVM compiler framework.

We show that the precision, accuracy, and the F1 score of LLOV is comparable to other checkers while being orders of magnitude faster.
